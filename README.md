## Hi there! 👋

I am a researcher in ecology and my work revolves mostly around birds and their relationship with the environment. Beyond profession, birdwatching occupies a prominent role in my life and is much more than a hobby. I am also passionate about poetry.

🔭 I am interested in various broad themes of ecology, such as community ecology, biogeography, functional ecology, evolution, etc. 

🪶 My passion for birding means that I am involved in citizen science in both my personal and my research lives.

💼 My current work uses eBird data to answer questions relating to bird migration, distributions and other aspects of bird ecology.

✒️ I love how languages work, and I believe that the written word holds immense power.
